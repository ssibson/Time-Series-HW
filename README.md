# Time Series Analysis Homework
## Assignment for Columbia FinTech Bootcamp


### **Time Series Forecasting Conclusions**
    1. *Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?* 
        Given the results generated by the ARMA and ARIMA analysis, I would not invest in the Yen with any level of confidence at this point in time.
    2. *Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?*
        Based on the data presented by the GARCH model, the volitility appears to be on the rise, and thus the risk in investment would be expected to increase.
    3. *Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?*
        Based solely on the model evaluation presented in the Time Series Analysis notebook, I would not feel especially confident in using these models for training. I do believe, however, that with further training of the models, they may have useful applications, and do provide useful pieces of information.

### **Linear Regression Forecasting Conclusions**
    1. *Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data?*
        Given the out-of-sample and in-sample RMSE values, the in-sample data performed better in this model. The out-of-sample data, while having a higher RMSE value, is not indicative of an overwhelming amount of overfitting, and is still a reasonably valuable indicator.
