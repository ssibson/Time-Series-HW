### **Time Series Forecasting Conclusions**
    1.  Given the results generated by the ARMA and ARIMA analysis, I would not invest in the Yen with any level of confidence at this point in time.
    2.  Based on the data presented by the GARCH model, the volitility appears to be on the rise, and thus the risk in investment would be expected to increase.
    3.  Based solely on the model evaluation presented in the Time Series Analysis notebook, I would not feel especially confident in using these models for training. I do believe, however, that with further training of the models, they may have useful applications, and do provide useful pieces of information.

### **Linear Regression Forecasting Conclusions**
    1.  Given the out-of-sample and in-sample RMSE values, the in-sample data performed better in this model. The out-of-sample data, while having a higher RMSE value, is not indicative of an overwhelming amount of overfitting, and is still a reasonably valuable indicator.
